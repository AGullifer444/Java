# Java Array vs. Array List
In Java programming, there are two ways to create a list of elements: in an array and an array list. These two array types share some common features but have some substantial differences that a programmer should evaluate when deciding which type to implement in their code. The number one key feature is that arrays are immutable when it comes to changing the array size, while array lists can be changed at any point in the code. A workaround for ensuring that an array will not come across an element deficiency is to vastly overestimate the number of elements that will occur in the code. An array list is an obvious choice when needing the flexibility to add or remove elements because these features are not available in an array simply because the size cannot be modified. A simple feature that can be done in both an array and an array list is the ability to modify an element by replacing it with an existing element. One last vital difference is that an array, when printed, will display the memory location of the array, while the array list will print the actual elements in the array. If one desires to see the elements in an array then it would be necessary to create a for loop to cycle through and print each element stored in that location.
